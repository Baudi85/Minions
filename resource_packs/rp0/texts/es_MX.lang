robot_t_01=<§bVoz de VNC§r> §3¿Crees que TÚ tienes lo necesario para unirte a los §6supervillanos§3? ¡Pues sintonizaste el canal correcto!	### So, you think YOU can become a super-villain? Well, you're tuned to the right channel! I work for The Villain Network Channel. You've been watching us. But we've also been watching you. Who I am is unimportant. Who YOU are and what YOU plan to do is what we're interested in. We've also been watching The Minions. They always follow the biggest, baddest villain. Well, they're following you. And that's when we at the VNC also become interested. Turns out there might be a powerful artifact hidden at your local record store, which is a front for a criminal organization known as the Vicious . Of course, you can do with this information what you will. Just remember... We're always watching. It's a Transport-O-Matic. We're still working on the name. It's a brilliant device that will teleport right back to your lair. Don't overuse it, though. It's still experimental. We still don't know where the last villain who used it is. By the way, I do recommend using your secret tunnel to go out. It's the fastest way to the record shop. Minions are surprisingly simple creatures, aren't they? Put them in a costume, and they'll start playing the part! I have no doubt that ANY Minion wearing this firefighter costume can't help but start putting out fires. But it's not a Minions strength to... think. That's where their evil boss comes into the picture. You must guide them... or in this case, dress them. Yes, the big city! Everyone here is positively trembling of the chaos you will rain down upon them! You could of course just stay on track here. The record shop I mentioned should be just down the road. However we're also very interested to see the Minions just going around the city. There’s plenty of opportunities to stir the hornet’s nest. So, explore to your heart’s content!

Your wall of trophies! Did you steal these or earn them? I guess it doesn't matter since you are a villain. This is an outdated teleportation device, is it? Not quite as advanced as the Transport-O-Matic but I suppose it gets the job done. A tool rack for evil gadgets. Ah, the thought of ingenuity on display excites me. A work in progress, yes?

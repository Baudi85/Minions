robot_t_01=<§bVNK-Stimme§r> §3Du meinst also, DU könntest zum §6Superschurken§3 werden? Tja, dann hast du den richtigen Sender!	### So, you think YOU can become a super-villain? Well, you're tuned to the right channel! I work for The Villain Network Channel. You've been watching us. But we've also been watching you. Who I am is unimportant. Who YOU are and what YOU plan to do is what we're interested in. We've also been watching The Minions. They always follow the biggest, baddest villain. Well, they're following you. And that's when we at the VNC also become interested. Turns out there might be a powerful artifact hidden at your local record store, which is a front for a criminal organization known as the Vicious . Of course, you can do with this information what you will. Just remember... We're always watching. It's a Transport-O-Matic. We're still working on the name. It's a brilliant device that will teleport right back to your lair. Don't overuse it, though. It's still experimental. We still don't know where the last villain who used it is. By the way, I do recommend using your secret tunnel to go out. It's the fastest way to the record shop. Minions are surprisingly simple creatures, aren't they? Put them in a costume, and they'll start playing the part! I have no doubt that ANY Minion wearing this firefighter costume can't help but start putting out fires. But it's not a Minions strength to... think. That's where their evil boss comes into the picture. You must guide them... or in this case, dress them. Yes, the big city! Everyone here is positively trembling of the chaos you will rain down upon them! You could of course just stay on track here. The record shop I mentioned should be just down the road. However we're also very interested to see the Minions just going around the city. There’s plenty of opportunities to stir the hornet’s nest. So, explore to your heart’s content!

There's some interesting locations marked on it, supposedly ones worth checking out. We think this is a list of all locations you have visited. Nice to keep track of, for nostalgic reasons, I guess. A storage box for all your items. Just because you are a super-villain doesn't mean you need to be super messy. A room just for Minions! I guess Minions need their own space for relaxing too. Your wall of trophies! Did you steal these or earn them? I guess it doesn't matter since you are a villain. This is an outdated teleportation device, is it? Not quite as advanced as the Transport-O-Matic but I suppose it gets the job done. A tool rack for evil gadgets. Ah, the thought of ingenuity on display excites me. A work in progress, yes? Villains must have their villain wheels, after all. It certainly already looks quite evil. We're looking forward to seeing the final product.

m3.post.6=<§bVNK-Stimme§r> §3Das ist sicherlich keine Falle. Schurken kann man auf jeden Fall vertrauen.	###Wow! Who woulda thought the Minions could learn Kung Fu?  Oh and hang on, before I forget. We've intercepted a message for you. Another villain wishes to meet you! Not sure how he heard of you? Not our fault! Don't blame the mainstream villain media! He wants to meet you at The Bank of Evil. He wants to collaborate. And by collaborate, he means rob the place. I'm sure it's not a trap. Villains are very trustworthy.

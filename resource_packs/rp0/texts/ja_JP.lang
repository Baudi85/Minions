robot_t_01=<§bVNC スポークスマン§r> §3あなたは§6大悪党§3になりたい? なら、このチャンネルがぴったりです!	### So, you think YOU can become a super-villain? Well, you're tuned to the right channel! I work for The Villain Network Channel. You've been watching us. But we've also been watching you. Who I am is unimportant. Who YOU are and what YOU plan to do is what we're interested in. We've also been watching The Minions. They always follow the biggest, baddest villain. Well, they're following you. And that's when we at the VNC also become interested. Turns out there might be a powerful artifact hidden at your local record store, which is a front for a criminal organization known as the Vicious . Of course, you can do with this information what you will. Just remember... We're always watching. It's a Transport-O-Matic. We're still working on the name. It's a brilliant device that will teleport right back to your lair. Don't overuse it, though. It's still experimental. We still don't know where the last villain who used it is. By the way, I do recommend using your secret tunnel to go out. It's the fastest way to the record shop. Minions are surprisingly simple creatures, aren't they? Put them in a costume, and they'll start playing the part! I have no doubt that ANY Minion wearing this firefighter costume can't help but start putting out fires. But it's not a Minions strength to... think. That's where their evil boss comes into the picture. You must guide them... or in this case, dress them. Yes, the big city! Everyone here is positively trembling of the chaos you will rain down upon them! You could of course just stay on track here. The record shop I mentioned should be just down the road. However we're also very interested to see the Minions just going around the city. There’s plenty of opportunities to stir the hornet’s nest. So, explore to your heart’s content!

Turns out there might be a powerful artifact hidden at your local record store, which is a front for a criminal organization known as the Vicious . Of course, you can do with this information what you will. Just remember... We're always watching. It's a Transport-O-Matic. We're still working on the name. It's a brilliant device that will teleport right back to your lair. Don't overuse it, though. It's still experimental. We still don't know where the last villain who used it is. By the way, I do recommend using your secret tunnel to go out. It's the fastest way to the record shop. Minions are surprisingly simple creatures, aren't they? Put them in a costume, and they'll start playing the part! I have no doubt that ANY Minion wearing this firefighter costume can't help but start putting out fires. But it's not a Minions strength to... think. That's where their evil boss comes into the picture. You must guide them... or in this case, dress them. Yes, the big city! Everyone here is positively trembling of the chaos you will rain down upon them! You could of course just stay on track here. The record shop I mentioned should be just down the road. However we're also very interested to see the Minions just going around the city. There’s plenty of opportunities to stir the hornet’s nest. So, explore to your heart’s content!

m2.post.1=<§bVNC スポークスマン§r> §3無事に戻れたようですね。お疲れ様でした。あ、実は、あなたがいない間にこっそりと調べものをしていました。	### So you've returned. Succesfully, it seems. We've taken the liberty of... snooping around a bit while you were gone. We looked at the devices in your lair and want to confirm that they do what we think they do. Your cooperation in this would be greatly... expected. Please walk up to each one and listen to our ideas. So this is just a digital map of the surrounding area. There's some interesting locations marked on it, supposedly ones worth checking out. We think this is a list of all locations you have visited. Nice to keep track of, for nostalgic reasons, I guess. A storage box for all your items. Just because you are a super-villain doesn't mean you need to be super messy. A room just for Minions! I guess Minions need their own space for relaxing too. Your wall of trophies! Did you steal these or earn them? I guess it doesn't matter since you are a villain. This is an outdated teleportation device, is it? Not quite as advanced as the Transport-O-Matic but I suppose it gets the job done. A tool rack for evil gadgets. Ah, the thought of ingenuity on display excites me. A work in progress, yes? Villains must have their villain wheels, after all. It certainly already looks quite evil. We're looking forward to seeing the final product.

My latest invention. eI need someone to test it out for me! You seem perfect! And by perfect, I mean expendable. See that stack of boxes up on the ledge there? You should be able to pull them down with the Sticky Hand. Give it a go! Now, you can use that to jump up the ledge! And once you're up, just grab it again to get to the next ledge! Excellent. Now, why don't you take it for a spin some more? There should be plenty of stuff to pull around down here. Go, go, I need more test results.
